# 📊 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python.  
It uses Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and Matplotlib for visualization.

The project studies how factors such as gender, test preparation, and subject scores affect student performance and presents the results using a mini dashboard.
